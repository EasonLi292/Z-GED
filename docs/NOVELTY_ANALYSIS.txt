GENERATED TOPOLOGIES FROM TEST CASES
================================================================================

Generated topologies from 18 test cases:
  1R+1C          : 10 circuits  ✅ In training
  2R             :  2 circuits  ❌ NOVEL (not in training)
  1R+1C+1L       :  2 circuits  ✅ In training
  2R+1C+1L       :  2 circuits  ✅ In training
  4R+1C+1L       :  1 circuits  ✅ In training
  2R+1C          :  1 circuits  ❌ NOVEL (not in training)

NOVELTY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Novel topologies (not in training data):
  2R             : 2 occurrences
    - 50 kHz, Q=2.5
    - 1 kHz, Q=5.0
  2R+1C          : 1 occurrences
    - 5 kHz, Q=20.0

================================================================================
GENERATION MODE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The model generates circuits through:
1. K-NN interpolation finds 5 nearest training examples by (frequency, Q)
2. Latent codes from those 5 examples are blended
3. Decoder generates circuit from interpolated latent code

Key question: Does interpolation create novel topologies?

Training topologies: {'2R+1C+1L', '1R+1C+1L', '1R+1C', '4R+1C+1L'}
Generated topologies: {'2R+1C', '2R', '1R+1C+1L', '4R+1C+1L', '1R+1C', '2R+1C+1L'}

Novel topologies generated: {'2R+1C', '2R'}


Validity of novel topologies:

  2R+1C:
    ✅ Has reactive components
    ⚠️ For 5 kHz, Q=20.0: needs both L and C for Q=20.0

  2R:
    ❌ Pure resistive - cannot provide frequency selectivity
    ❌ Invalid topology for filter design

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

✅ The model DOES generate novel topologies!

Novel topology count: 2
Novel topology instances: 3 out of 18 test cases

However, the novel topologies are INVALID:
- All novel topologies are pure resistive (2R)
- Pure resistive circuits cannot provide frequency selectivity
- These are generation failures, not successful novel designs

The model's "novelty" is actually a bug:
- It generates topologies that don't exist in training
- But these topologies are physically invalid for the task
- Model lacks constraints to prevent invalid topology generation

True novelty would be:
- Valid RLC combinations not in training data
- Novel but functional circuit structures
- Creative solutions within physical constraints
